%Suppose our target is to design a filter to pass all frequencies below 1200 Hz with pass band 
%ripples = 1 dB and minimum stop band attenuation of 50 dB at 1500 Hz. The sampling frequency 
%for the filter is 8000 Hz;
fs=8000;
[n,w]=buttord(1200/4000,1500/4000,1,50); % finding the order of the filter
[b,a]=butter(n,w); % finding zeros and poles for filter
